IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 8 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with sequence duplicates removed has already
been printed to file /projects/tallis/binghui2/pipeline/datasets/500M4/R13/rose.aln.true.fasta.reduced
