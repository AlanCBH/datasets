it will now try to parse it as FASTA file



IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences SBIE and SCJB are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences SFCI and SGIJ are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.
