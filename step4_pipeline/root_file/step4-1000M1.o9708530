IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences SDGI and SIIC are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences SJFD and SJCI are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences SJFB and SCEJ are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 3 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.
