RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file



IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences SCFG and SCA are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with sequence duplicates removed has already
been printed to file /projects/tallis/binghui2/step4_pipeline/datasets/1000M1/R2/rose.aln.true.fasta.reduced
