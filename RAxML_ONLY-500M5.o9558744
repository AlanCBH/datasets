RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file



IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences SCAG and SDCD are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences SDED and SDBB are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with sequence duplicates removed has already
been printed to file /projects/tallis/binghui2/19fa/large_aligments/datasets/500M5/R15/rose.aln.true.fasta.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs"
